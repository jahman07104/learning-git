# learning-git
CS50W lecture
I created this to save notes on how to use git and github.These notes are based on a lecture on Edx.org.
I plan to use this as a blue print for future git hub repositories.
So step #1
On the github site create a repository
step #2
in your code editor
run git clone
step #3
create a file
step $4
run git add + file name that you just created
step #5
run git status to see what you have
then run git commit -m"message"
to commit and include a message
 we can also use -am meaning I add all the messages
 step #6
 we then run git push to push the changes up to the repository
 *******
 Git Pull os the opposite of git push ..it will get the latest code from the repository
